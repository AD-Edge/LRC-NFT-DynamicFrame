# LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame
A dynamic-frame template for canvas/html-based NFT dev.

# About
This setup is designed to scale the canvas/setup overall to fit in a variety of wallets.
An issue I ran into given the lack of consistency between different wallet types we have now (and going into the unknown future).

This template by default scales between a minimum of 320px (GME wallet smallest size) and maximum of 720px (for higher res requirements), but can be modified as needed.

# LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame [Introduction Tutorial]

**Note: This tutorial is not yet complete! - I'm working on it :)

## About

An introductory tutorial which covers the following areas: Initial setup & what you need to get started making html/canvas based NFTs -> how html/canvas NFTs & the **LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame** template works -> simple edits to the base template and finally minting the NFT itself - all on Loopring Layer2! ([see below](https://github.com/AD-Edge/LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame/blob/main/documentation/intro_tutorial.md#whats-involved-in-each-section-at-a-glance) for a more detailed breakdown)

This tutorial covers using the **LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame** template to get up and running building your own interactive NFTs! Want to produce and sell text adventure games? Or a pacman clone? Some kind of mind-bending puzzle for touch screen devices? Or display a product/project in a way which lets the owner of the NFT interact directly with your creation? These are the kinds of ideas this tutorial should help you get started working towards!

My **LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame** template is designed to act as a 'standard' or foundation for any kind of html/canvas NFT. Theres a variety of design issues to solve when it comes to building an NFT which 'fits' into L2 wallets past, present and future (theres already enough variety in sizes and constraints). I wanted to solve those issues and future proof this template so no one else has to waste time on these issues. Less time fighting with CSS -> more time coding fun things! :) So whether youre new to web dev entirely, never minted an NFT on L2 before (or at all), or if youre just wanting to see how this template works down at a code level - this tutorial will cover these topics!

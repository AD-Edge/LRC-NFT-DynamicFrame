# Intro Part00 - Setup & Development Environment

<hr>

[Under Construction]

## Requirements for this Tutorial

At its simplest, for this tutorial we will need to setup:

1) A Layer 2 Loopring Wallet (or Metamask, GME or equivilant L2 wallet) and a few dollars of crypto to cover minting costs (only required if you actually want to mint the NFT)
2) A dev-environment (IDE or text-editor) 
3) The LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame template files & folders

## Loopring Layer2 (L2) Wallet

Metamask (L2 activated)

GME wallet (L2 activated)

## Setting up your development environment with VSCode

Sometimes for web/NFT dev this can be as complicated as setting up an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) but at its most basic you can literally just use notepad. This is where we edit our code and make changes.

Unless you have your own IDE/text editor of choice and a L2 wallet setup, you can skip to the next section now. 

If not, I'd recommend setting up/using VSCode.

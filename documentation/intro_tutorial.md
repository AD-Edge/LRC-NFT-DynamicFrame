# LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame [Introduction Tutorial]

**Note: This tutorial is not yet complete! - I'm working on it :)

An intro-tutorial covering setup -> how html/canvas NFTs files & this NFT template work -> simple edits to the base template and finally minting the NFT itself - all on Loopring Layer2!

This tutorial covers using my **LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame** template to get up and running building your own interactive NFTs. Want to make and sell text adventure games? Or a pacman clone? Or some kind of puzzle? Or display a product or project in a way which lets the owner/user of the NFT interact hands on? Thats what this tutorial is all about!

My **LRC-NFT-DynamicFrame** template is designed to act as a 'standard' or foundation for any kind of html/canvas NFT. Theres a variety of design issues to solve when it comes to having an NFT which fits into L2 wallets past, present and future. I wanted to solve those issues and future proof this template so no one else has to waste time on it. So whether youre new to web dev entirely, never minted an NFT on L2 before (or at all), or if youre just wanting to see how this template works down at a code level - this tutorial will cover these topics!
